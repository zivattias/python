A Python code is a process:
In computing, a process is an instance of a computer program that is being executed.

Any process has 3 basic components:
1. An executable program.
2. The associated data needed by the program (variables, work space, buffers, etc.)
3. The execution context of the program (State of process)

Multiprocessing or multithreading is the execution of multiple processes concurrently (simultaneously).


If your program is IO-bound, both multithreading and multiprocessing in Python will work smoothly.
However, if the code is CPU-bound and your machine has multiple cores, multiprocessing would be a better choice.
